Objective

Develop a turn-based 5x5 board game where two players compete using 5 pieces each: 3 pawns (P1, P2, P3), 1 Hero1 (H1), and 1 Hero2 (H2). This project was developed as part of the HitWicket Software Engineer assignment.
Game Rules ðŸ“œ

    Piece Movement:
        Pawn (P1, P2, P3): Moves one block in any direction (L, R, F, B).
        Hero1 (H1): Moves exactly two blocks in any straight direction (L, R, F, B) and captures opponent pieces.
        Hero2 (H2): Moves exactly two blocks diagonally (FL, FR, BL, BR) and captures opponent pieces.

    Player Interaction:
        Players will take turns selecting a piece and move it using the following commands:
            F (Forward)
            L (Left)
            B (Backward)
            R (Right)
            FL (Forward-Left)
            FR (Forward-Right)
            BL (Backward-Left)
            BR (Backward-Right)
        Each move will be executed, and the board will be updated accordingly.

    Turn Exchange:
        Players will alternate turns, with one turn per player.

    Board Updates and Captures:
        The board will be updated after each valid move.
        Captures will be handled if an opponent's piece is in the path of a Hero piece's movement.

    Move History:
        A move history will be maintained and displayed during the game. (e.g., "Player A moved P1 Forward").
